Just the right level of guidance, helpful and still gives you a lot of freedom to explore and learn for yourself.\n>\n> [Maya Farber Brodsky](https://farberbrodsky.com/)\n\n> Huge fan of \"build your own x\". Really glad there's a nicely polished challenge site for them. Definitely going to recommend to others!\n>\n> [John Olheiser](https://github.com/jolheiser)\n\n> It is great to see this kind of a platform evolving which is entirely different from the traditional coding platforms which we see typically see on internet.\n>\n> [Asnim P Ansari](https://github.com/asnimansari)\n\n> I think the instant feedback right there in the git push is really cool. Didn't even know that was possible!\n>\n> [Patrick Burris](https://github.com/Jumballaya)\n\n> The Redis challenge was extremely fun; I think I mostly have feedback for the Redis and Python asyncio docs themselves. :laughing: I think I expected more hand-holding from the challenge; I ended up having to read the Redis Protocol specification doc pretty carefully in its entirety, which may have been your intent! The result felt like lightly-guided independent study, if that makes sense.

Try these steps.\n\n**1. Turn on debug mode**\n\nIf you don't have debug mode already, turn it on. When debug mode is one, the tester emits verbose logs that can help you better understand what it is doing.\n\nYou can enable debug mode by editing the `.codecrafters.yml` file in the root of your repository and pushing a new commit to trigger a build.\n\nHere's what test output looks like with debug mode turned off (the default):\n\n![](/assets/images/code-without-debug.png)\n\nand here's what it looks like with debug mode turned on:\n\n![](/assets/images/code-with-debug.png)\n\n**2. Try adding logs in your code**\n\nUse the infamous [printf() debugging](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/189562/what-is-the-proper-name-for-doing-debugging-by-adding-print-statements/189570#189570) technique. Any output on stderr/stdout from your program will be visible in the test logs with the `[your_program]` prefix.\n\nAdding logs in your code can help narrow down the problem.\n\n**3. Ask for help**\n\nIf you're still struggling with a bug that is hard to track down, feel free to ask in [[Discord|glossary#discord]]!\n","url":"https://docs.codecrafters.io/notes/2c636ecb-eb59-45b5-a4c0-15f49e9b489b.html","relUrl":"notes/2c636ecb-eb59-45b5-a4c0-15f49e9b489b.html"},{"doc":"Glossary","title":"Glossary","hpath":"glossary","content":"\n## Discord\n\n\"Discord\" as used in this documentation refers to our [Discord](https://discord.com/) server.\n\n![](/assets/images/discord-preview.png)\n\nHere's [a link](https://discord.com/channels/673463293901537291/673463294543003680) to access the server.\n\nIf you're an early access user or a paid user, you should have access to this already.

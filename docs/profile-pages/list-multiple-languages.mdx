title: "Can I list multiple languages on my profile page?"

Yes! When you complete a challenge in multiple languages, all of them will be visible on your profile page.

Here's an example where a user has completed the same challenge in both C & Python:

<Frame>
  <img class="w-full" src="/img/profile-page-example.png" />
</Frame>

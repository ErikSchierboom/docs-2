A CodeCrafters membership grants you access to Anonymous Mode. It allows you to hide your GitHub username and avatar on CodeCrafters.

## What is Anonymous Mode?

Anonymous Mode masks the GitHub username and avatar on your CodeCrafters profile.

Your code examples and profile will still be public but under a random username and profile picture.

Once anonymous mode is enabled, it will not be disabled, even if your membership expires.

## How do I enable it?

To enable Anonymous Mode:

1. Click on your username on the top right corner of the page.
2. Select **Settings** from the dropdown menu
3. Locate the **Anonymous Mode** option and toggle the button next to it to activate

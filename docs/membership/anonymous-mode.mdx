  mode.
</Tip>

A CodeCrafters membership grants you access to anonymous mode. It allows you to hide your GitHub username and avatar on CodeCrafters.

## What is anonymous mode?

Anonymous mode masks the GitHub username and avatar on your CodeCrafters profile.

Your code examples and profile will still be public but under a random username and profile picture.

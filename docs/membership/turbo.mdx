## What are turbo test runs?

Turbo test runs are given first priority by our test runners and execute faster than regular test runs.

In times of high demand, regular test runs might be queued while turbo test runs are executed immediately.

If you have an active CodeCrafters membership, all of your test runs will be turbo test runs.

## How do I know if my test run is a turbo test run?

You'll see this at the top of your test run output.

If your test run is a turbo test run, you'll see this:

<Frame>
  <img className="w-full" src="/img/membership/turbo.png" />
</Frame>

If your test run is not a turbo test run, you'll see this:

<Frame>
  <img className="w-full" src="/img/membership/not-turbo.png" />
</Frame>

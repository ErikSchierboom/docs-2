</Tip>

A CodeCrafters membership grants you unlimited access to our [catalog](https://app.codecrafters.io/catalog). You'll also get early access to
all content we'll release in the future.

## What content can I access for free without a CodeCrafters membership?

All of our content is available in a "read-only" format for free. This means that you can view all of the stage instructions and hints, but
you won't be able to submit code or run tests for any stages you don't have access to.

Without a CodeCrafters membership, you can run tests and submit code for:

- All stages in any challenge currently marked as "Free" in the [catalog](https://app.codecrafters.io/catalog)
- The first 2 stages of any challenge (including those not marked as "Free")

With a CodeCrafters membership, you can run tests and submit code for all stages in any challenge.

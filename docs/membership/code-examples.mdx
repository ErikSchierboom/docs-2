<Tip>
  [Upgrade here](https://app.codecrafters.io/pay) to get access to code examples for all stages.
</Tip>

A CodeCrafters membership grants you access to code examples. This means that you view code from other users when working on CodeCrafters challenges.

## What are code examples?

Code examples are snippets of code from other users who passed a stage. Here's what they look like:

<Frame>
  <img className="w-full" src="/img/membership/code-examples.png" />
</Frame>

{/* Most code examples also include AI-generated comments inline. These comments can help if you're new to a language or unfamiliar with common constructs. Example:

<Frame>
  <img className="w-full" src="/img/membership/code-example-comments.png" />
</Frame> */}

## What code examples can I access for free without a CodeCrafters membership?

Without a CodeCrafters membership, you can view:

- All code examples for early stages
- Upto 2 code examples for other stages

A CodeCrafters membership grants you access to all recent code examples for a stage, in any language.

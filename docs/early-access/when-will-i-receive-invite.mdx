title: "When will I receive my invite?"
---

The maximum delay in sending out invites is **30 days**, not more.

We're intentionally sending out invites slowly, so that we can work on feedback before the next invites hit.

There is no acceptance criteria for invites. Everyone _will_ get an invite, and we send them on a first-come first-serve basis.

If a friend of yours received an invite earlier than you did and you want to take part in early access trials with them, you can [write to us](mailto:hello@codecrafters.io) and we'll fast-track your invite.

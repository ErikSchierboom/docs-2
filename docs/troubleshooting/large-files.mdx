If you encounter an error like this, it's likely due to inadvertently committing files that are too large or not meant to be tracked (e.g., binaries or `node_modules/`).


## Instructions

    Run the following command:
    ```bash
    git rm paths_to_large_files

    For example to delete the `./server` and `./release/target` binaries shown in the screenshot above, run the following command:

    ```bash
    git rm --cached server release/target
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Commit the changes">
    After removing all the large files from the GIt repository. commit the changes:

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Remove large files"
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

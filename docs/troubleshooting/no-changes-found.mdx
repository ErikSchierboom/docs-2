When pushing your changes, you might see a message indicating that no changes were found.

{/* <Frame>

</Frame> */}

This most likely means that you haven't run `git add .` before running `git commit` and `git push`.

Make sure to run all these three commands in order:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "<your_commit_message>"
git push origin master
```

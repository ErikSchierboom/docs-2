title: "Publishing concepts"
---

Once your concept is ready, you can "publish" it by linking it to a challenge. To do this,
you'll need to send a PR to the challenge's GitHub repository.

- Find the challenge's GitHub repository, like https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-redis.
- Edit the [`course-definition.yml`](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-redis/blob/main/course-definition.yml) file.
- Add your concept's slug to the top-level `concept_slugs` key.
- If the concept applies to specific stages, also add it to the `concept_slugs` key in the relevant stage.

title: "Testing concepts"
---

Before publishing concepts, we recommend testing them out yourself and with a few friends if possible.

When you're an expert in a topic, it's easy to miss things that are confusing to beginners. Real-world feedback is
the best way to find these gaps. If you can observe someone using your concept live, there's nothing like it.

Feel free to also ask for feedback in our [Discord server](/community/discord-access), users are always happy to help!

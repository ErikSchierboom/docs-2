title: "Creating concepts"
---

To create a concept, visit the [Concepts](https://app.codecrafters.io/concepts) page and click the "Create Concept" button.

**Notes**:

- The [index](https://app.codecrafters.io/concepts) page is still a work in progress.
  - Any concepts you create will show up on this page, there's no "draft" state.
  - This is fine because we don't link to the index page anywhere.
  - For now the only way users access concepts is by a direct link like https://app.codecrafters.io/concepts/network-protocols.
- The "Create Concept" button is only visible to users accepted into the concept creator program. If you don't see the button,
  contact [Paul](mailto:paul@codecrafters.io).

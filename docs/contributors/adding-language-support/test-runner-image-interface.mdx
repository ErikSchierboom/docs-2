title: "Test Runner Image Interface"
description: "Learn about how to structure a test runner image for the CodeCrafters test runner"
---

The test runner builds user's code (based on the [Starter Code](/contributors/adding-language-support/starter-code)) with the
corresponding [Dockerfile](/contributors/adding-language-support/dockerfiles) to build a Test Runner Image.

The test runner script is run within a container based on this image.

## Test Runner Script

The test runner script roughly follows this flow:

- Builds the test runner image.
  - This step is only run it a test runner image doesn't exist, or if any files in `CODECRAFTERS_DEPENDENCY_FILE_PATHS` have changed.
  - Logs from this step are prefixed with `[build]`.
- Copies any files in `/app-cached` to `$CODECRAFTERS_SUBMISSION_DIR` if present.
- Sets `CODECRAFTERS_SUBMISSION_DIR` to `/app`
  - This value is subject to change in the future, hence the use of an environment variable.
- Runs `/codecrafters-precompile.sh` if it exists.
  - Logs from this step are prefixed with `[compile]`.
- Sets `CODECRAFTERS_TEST_CASES_JSON` based on the current test run.
- Runs the tester program ([example](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/redis-tester))
  - Logs from this step are streamed directly with no prefix, the tester program is expected to add prefixes like "[stage-1]", "[stage-2]" etc. to its logs.
  - The exit code of this step (0 or 1) is used to determine if the test run passed or failed.

## Performance

We use three different techniques to ensure user's code is built & run as fast as possible. Depending on the language, you might or might not need to use all of these techniques.

### 1. Dockerfile Caching

The test runner will look for a `CODECRAFTERS_DEPENDENCY_FILE_PATHS` environment variable in the image. It will only re-build the image if the files listed in the variable change.

A Dockerfile can contain steps to install dependencies, like `cargo install` for Rust, and `npm install` for JavaScript.

Since files like `Cargo.toml` & `package.json` don't change often, this helps avoid re-installing dependencies on every run.

Any Dockerfile steps that emit output will be printed to the user's test run logs with the `[build]` prefix.

</Frame>

**Notes**:

- If you want a Dockerfile step's output to not be included in `[build]` logs, you can add `> /dev/null` to the end of the command.
- If a `CODECRAFTERS_DEPENDENCY_FILE_PATHS` environment variable is not present, the test runner will never re-build the image.

### 2. Compilation

If `/codecrafters-precompile.sh` is present in the image, it will be run once before invoking the tester.

This is useful with compiled languages like Rust, where the first compilation can take a long time, but running the compiled binary is fast.

Logs from this script will be printed to the user's test run logs with the `[compile]` prefix.

  <img className="w-full" src="/img/contributors/compile-logs.png" />
</Frame>

**Notes**:

- The `/codecrafters-precompile.sh` script can choose to edit the executable script (like `./your_bittorrent.sh`) to remove any compilation steps.

### 3. Cached Files

If any files are placed in `/app-cached`, they will be copied to `/app` folder (overwriting any of the user's code) before running the tester.

This can be used to store files required for incremental compilation in languages that support it.

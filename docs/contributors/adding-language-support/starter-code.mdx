Starter code is the code that we provide to users when they start a challenge. It's the code that they'll be building on top of.

[Here's an example](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-redis/tree/main/compiled_starters/python).

### Pass first stage

###

Since starter code for different languages are likely to have a lot of similar code, we use templates to create these.

- The raw files are stored under [`starter_templates`](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-redis/tree/main/starter_templates), the compiled versions are under
  [`compiled_starters`](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-redis/tree/main/compiled_starters).
- The [`starter-repository-definitions.yml`](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-redis/blob/main/starter-repository-definitions.yml) file contains
  the mapping from template files to their corresponding compiled paths.

Starter code is the code that we provide to users when they start a challenge. It's the code that they'll be building on top of.

[Here's an example](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-redis/tree/main/compiled_starters/python).

## Required Files

At the minimum, starter code is expected to have the following files:

- `README.md`
  - A README file that explains how to run the starter code & submit code to CodeCrafters.
- `codecrafters.yml`
  - A YAML file with the keys `language_pack` and `debug`.
  - The name of this files depends on the challenge. `your_docker.sh` for Docker, `your_git.sh` for Git etc.
- An executable script that runs the starter code.
- Skeleton code that the user will build upon.
  - This code must also include a section that can be uncommented to pass the first stage.
- Any configuration files commonly required by the language / package managers.
  - For example, `requirements.txt` for Python, `package.json` for JavaScript etc.
- `.gitignore`
  - A `.gitignore` file that ignores files commonly ignored by the language.
- `.gitattributes`
  - A `.gitattributes` file that sets the `text=auto` for all files (to avoid issues with line endings on Windows).

## First stage solution

To make it easier for users to get started, we automatically generate a solution to the first stage of the challenge. This is done by uncommenting lines in the starter code.

**Example**:

<Frame caption="Stage 1 solution, auto-generated from starter code">
  <img className="w-full" src="/img/contributors/first-stage-solution.png" />
</Frame>

The way this works is that [course-sdk](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/course-sdk) will look for markers like this in the starter code:

```python
# Uncomment this to pass the first stage
```

These markers will be deleted and any code after them will be uncommented to generate the solution.

The full logic for this is [here](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/course-sdk/blob/4beb239db2293a5a5b109dac737c6a2d70d62d1a/lib/compilers/first-stage-solutions-compiler.ts).

## Templates

Since starter code for different languages are likely to have a lot of similar code, we use templates to create these.

- The raw files are stored under [starter_templates](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-redis/tree/main/starter_templates), the compiled versions are under
  [compiled_starters](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-redis/tree/main/compiled_starters).
- The [starter-repository-definitions.yml](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-redis/blob/main/starter-repository-definitions.yml) file contains
  the mapping from template files to their corresponding compiled paths.

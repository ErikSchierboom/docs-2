A Dockerfile is used to build the Docker container where a user's code will be run. We require
one Dockerfile per language version supported.

Dockerfiles are stored in the `dockerfiles` directory of a challenge repository.

[Example](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-redis/tree/main/dockerfiles)

## Language Versions

We support multiple versions of a language by creating a Dockerfile for each version.

The name of the Dockerfile should match the `language_pack` value used in the starter code's `codecrafters.yml` file.

For example, for the dockerfile `python-3.11.Dockerfile`, the relevant section in `codecrafters.yml` will look something like this:

```yaml
# Use this to change the Python version used to run your code
# on Codecrafters.
#
# Available versions: python-3.11
language_pack: python-3.11
```

A language pack usually only specifies the minor version of a language. For example, we support `python-3.11` and `python-3.12` but not `python-3.11.1`.

### Dockerfile Structure

- Where available, use the official Docker image for the language.
- Where available, use an image based on `alpine` to reduce the size of the image.
- A Dockerfile must install all dependencies required to run the user's code.
  - It must copy in the minimal set of files from the user's code required to install dependencies. For example, for Rust this'd be `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock`.
  - It must then run the dependency installation command. For example, for Rust this'd be `cargo build --release`.
- The files required to build dependencies must be stored as CSV in the `CODECRAFTERS_DEPENDENCY_FILE_PATHS` environment variable, so that CodeCrafters can detect
  changes in them and trigger a rebuild when needed.
- A Dockerfile must only copy in the User's code as the last step. This allows us to share the cached layers between different users.

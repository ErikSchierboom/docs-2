For a CodeCrafters challenge to support a language, we need the following things in place:

- Starter code
- A Dockerfile

We have comprehensive CI tests in place to ensure that the starter code and Dockerfile for each language are valid.

## Starter code

The starter code is the code that'll be provided to users when they start a challenge.

## Dockerfile

This'll be used to build the container used to run user's code.

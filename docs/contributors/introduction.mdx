You can help us build CodeCrafters in the following ways:

## Vote on challenge/extension ideas

Help us prioritize which <Tooltip tip="Challenges are guided projects that involve building real-world applications">Challenges</Tooltip> and <Tooltip tip="Extension are additions to challenges that expand their scope.">Extensions</Tooltip> to build next by voting on ideas. You can also submit your own ideas for
challenges and extensions.

- **Effort**: It usually takes 1-2 hours to add support for a new language.

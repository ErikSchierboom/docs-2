# Local development

To run the code for your challenge locally, you'll need `Python` installed. Our test runners use `Python` version `3.12` (as of April 2024).

The script for your challenge (like `./spawn_redis_server.sh`) will run the code using this version of the Python interpreter. It looks something like this:
```sh
#!/bin/sh

exec python3 -m app.main "$@"
```

# File structure

- The files for your solution are placed in the `app/` directory.
- `app/main.py` contains the `main` function, which is what the test runner executes.

# Adding more files

You can add more files and directories to `app/`. The test runner will include them when compiling your code.

For example, if you added a file at `app/foo.py`, you could use it like so:

<CodeGroup>
```Python app/foo.py
def foo():
    print("Hello world!")
````

```Python app/main.py

from app.foo import foo

def main():
    foo() // Uses the foo function from foo.py
```

</CodeGroup>

# Adding dependencies

You can add dependencies to your project by installing them using `pip`

For example, to add the `requests` library, you can run the following command:

```bash
$ pip install requests
```

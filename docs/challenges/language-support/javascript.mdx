# Local development

To run the code for your challenge locally, you'll need `node` installed. Our test runners use Node 18 (as of April 2024).

The script for your challenge (like `./your_grep.sh`) will automatically compile your code using `node` before executing it. It'll
look something like this:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

exec node app/main.js "$@"
```

# File structure

- The files for your solution are placed in the `app/` directory.
- `app/main.js` contains the `main()` function, which is what the test runner executes.

# Adding more files

You can add more files and directories to `app/`. The test runner will include them when compiling your code.

For example, if you add a file at `app/foo.js`, you could use it like so:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript app/foo.js
function foo() {
    console.log('Hello from foo!');
}

function bar() {
console.log('Hello from bar!');
}

module.exports = { foo, bar };

````

```javascript app/main.js
const { foo, bar } = require('./foo');

function main() {
    foo();  // prints 'Hello from foo!'
    bar();  // prints 'Hello from bar!'
}
````

</CodeGroup>

<Note>We use the CommonJS syntax for `import` / `export` of modules.</Note>

# Adding dependencies

You can add dependencies to your project using `npm`

For example, to add the gson library, add the following to the `<dependencies>` section in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.google.code.gson</groupId>
  <artifactId>gson</artifactId>
  <version>2.8.6</version>
</dependency>
```

When you push your code next, the runner will automatically download the dependency.

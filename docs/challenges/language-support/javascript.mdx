# Local development

To run the code for your challenge locally, you'll need `node` installed. Our test runners use Node 18 (as of April 2024).

The script for your challenge (like `./your_grep.sh`) will automatically compile your code using `node` before executing it. It'll
look something like this:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

exec node app/main.js "$@"
```

# File structure

- The files for your solution are placed in the `app/` directory.
- The test runner executes `app/main.js`

# Adding more files

You can add more files and directories to `app/`. The test runner will include them when compiling your code.

For example, if you add a file at `app/foo.js`, you could use it like so:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript app/foo.js
function foo() {
    console.log('Hello from foo!');
}

function bar() {
console.log('Hello from bar!');
}

module.exports = { foo, bar };

````

```javascript app/main.js
const { foo, bar } = require('./foo');


foo();  // prints 'Hello from foo!'
bar();  // prints 'Hello from bar!'
````

</CodeGroup>

<Note>We use the CommonJS syntax for `import` / `export` of modules.</Note>

# Adding dependencies

You can add dependencies to your project using `npm`

For example, to add the `lodash` library, run the following command:

```bash
npm i lodash
```

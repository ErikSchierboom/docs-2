# Local development

To run the code for your challenge locally, you'll need `cmake` & `make` installed. Our test runners use Java 21 (as of November 2023).

The script for your challenge (like `./your_sqlite3.sh`) will automatically compile your code using the rules defined in `CMakeLists.txt` before executing it. It'll
look something like this:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

set -e
cmake $(dirname $0) > /dev/null
make > /dev/null
exec ./server "$@"
```

# File structure

- The files for your solution are placed in the `src/` directory.
- `src/Server.cpp` contains the `main` function, which is what the test runner executes.

# Adding more files

You can add more files and directories to `src/`. The test runner will include them when compiling your code.

For example, if you added a file at `src/Foo.hpp`, you could use it like so:

<CodeGroup>
```cpp src/Foo.hpp
#pragma once

#include <iostream>

void foo() {
std::cout << "Hello, World!";
}

````

```cpp src/Server.cpp
#include "Foo.hpp"

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    foo()   // calls foo() defined in src/Foo.hpp
}
````

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  `#pragma once` is a preprocessor directive that ensures the header file is
  only included once to prevent any duplication issues.
</Note>

# Adding dependencies

Adding third-party dependencies to a C++ project involves the following steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download the library">
    Download the library files from the source.
    <Note>
      Some libraries come built into your operating system and don't need to be
      installed. E.g. `pthread` comes built-in to Unix systems (Linux and
      macOS).{" "}
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update your Include Path">
 Add the following line to your `CMakeLists.txt` file:

```CMake
include_directories(/path/to/my_library/include)
```

    This will tell the compiler where to find the headers for your library.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Link against the library">
    Add the following line to the `CMakeLists.txt` file:
```CMake
target_link_libraries(server my_library)
```

This will link the library against the build target.

  </Step>
</Steps>

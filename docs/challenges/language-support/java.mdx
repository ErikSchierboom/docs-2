# Local development

To run the code for your challenge locally, you'll need `java` & `mvn` installed. Our test runners use Java 21 (as of November 2023).

The script for your challenge (like `./your_bittorrent.sh`) will automatically compile your code using `mvn` before executing it. It'll
look something like this:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -e
mvn -B --quiet package -Ddir=/tmp/codecrafters-redis-target
exec java -jar /tmp/codecrafters-redis-target/java_redis.jar "$@"
```

When running tests on our servers, the `mvn` command will only be run once and then commented out. This ensures that each test only runs the `java -jar ...` line.

# File structure

- The files for your solution are placed in the `src/main/java` directory.
- `src/main/java/Main.java` contains the `Main` function, which is what the test runner executes.

# Adding more files

You can add more files and directories to the `src/main/java` directory. The test runner will include them when compiling your code.

**TODO**: Add an example of adding a file.

<Note>
  This section is incomplete, and we'd love your help expanding it. We're already
  got a similar section in the [Kotlin Guide](/challenges/language-support/kotlin) that you can use as a reference. If you'd like to help out, please
  open a PR at [codecrafters-io/docs](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/docs).
</Note>

{/* For example, if you added a file at `app/foo.zig`, you could use it like so:

<CodeGroup>

```zig app/foo.zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn bar() void {
  std.debug.print("Hello World!", .{});
}
```

```zig app/main.zig
const foo = @import("foo.zig");

pub fn main() void {
  foo.bar() // Uses the bar function from foo.zig
}
```

</CodeGroup>

You can also add files in subdirectories. For example, if you added a file at `app/foo/bar.zig`, you could use it like so:

<CodeGroup>

```zig app/foo/bar.zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn baz() void {
  std.debug.print("Hello World!", .{});
}
```

```zig app/main.zig
const bar = @import("foo/bar.zig");

pub fn main() void {
  bar.baz() // Uses the baz function from foo/bar.zig
}
```

</CodeGroup>

# Adding dependencies

You can add dependencies to your project by adding them to your `pom.xml` file.

For example, to add the gson library, add the following to the `<dependencies>` section in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.google.code.gson</groupId>
  <artifactId>gson</artifactId>
  <version>2.8.6</version>
</dependency>
```

When you push your code next, the runner will automatically download the dependency.

CodeCrafters challenges are designed to be solved using your favorite programming language. The tester code for most challenges is
language-agnostic, so the challenge itself can support any language.

We currently support Rust, Python & Go by default for all challenges. Other languages are in beta, and may not be supported for all challenges.

<Info>
  If you're interested in contributing support for a new language, check out our
  [contributing guide](/contributors/adding-language-support/introduction).

# Local development

To run the code for your challenge locally, you'll need `opam` and `dune` installed. Our test runners use Dune v3.16 (as of September 2024).

The script for your challenge (`./your_program.sh`) will run the code using these tools. It might look something like this:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

dune build --build-dir /tmp/redis
exec /tmp/redis/default/main.exe "$@"
```

# File structure

- The files for your solution are placed in the `src/` directory.
- `src/main.ml` is the entry point for your OCaml program.

# Adding more files

You can organize your code by adding more `.ml` and `.mli` files in the `src/` directory. The test runner will include them when building and running your code.

For example, if you add a file at `src/foo.ml`, you can reference it in `main.ml` like this:

<CodeGroup>

```ocaml src/foo.ml
let bar () = Printf.printf "Hello World!\n"
```

```ocaml src/main.ml
let () = Foo.bar () (* Calls the bar function from foo.ml *)
```

</CodeGroup>

Make sure to update your `dune` file if you add new modules:

```dune
(executable
 (name main)
 (modules main foo))
```

Refer to the [Dune documentation](https://dune.readthedocs.io/) for more details on building OCaml projects.

<Note>
  Remember to add the functions you want to expose in the corresponding `.mli`
  interface files, if needed.
</Note>

# Adding dependencies

You can add dependencies by editing the `dune-project` file.

For example, to add `base` as a dependency, you would modify `dune-project` like so:

```
(package
 (depends base))
```

You'll also need to update your `dune` file to include the dependency:

```dune
(executable
 (name main)
 (libraries base))
```

This will allow you to use the `base` library in your code.

For more details, check the [OCaml documentation](https://ocaml.org/docs/managing-dependencies#adding-a-dependency-to-your-dune-project-file).

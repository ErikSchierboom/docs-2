title: "How do I fix errors when cloning my repository?"
---

When you start a CodeCrafters challenge, we create a Git repository for you to work in. If you're facing issues cloning your repository,
here are a few things you can try:

# Check our status page

Visit https://status.codecrafters.io/ and make sure that the "Git Operations" component is green.

<Frame>
  <img className="w-full" src="/img/fix-clone-errors/git-status.png" />
</Frame>

If the "Git Operations" component is red, it means that we're experiencing issues with our Git infrastructure. In this case, wait for the
issue to be resolved and then try cloning your repository again.

# Check connectivity to git.codecrafters.io

If the status page looks good, the next step is to check if you can connect to `git.codecrafters.io`. You can do this by running:

```sh
curl -vvv https://git.codecrafters.io
```

The logs should look something like this:

```sh

If you see a "connection timed out" error instead, this could be due to a firewall or network issue. We recommend disabling your firewall or using a different
network to see if that resolves the issue.

Sometimes, depending on your ISP's rules, using a VPN can help resolve this issue. If you don't have a VPN installed, we recommend using [1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1/).

If none of these options work, please reach out to us at [hello@codecrafters.io](mailto:hello@codecrafters.io) and we'll take a look!

title: "Can I install additional dependencies?"
description: "From frequently asked questions"

No. This is intentional. All our challenges are purposefully designed to be completed using a pre-defined set of dependencies, which you'll find installed by default.

We choose these dependencies carefully. For the most part, you should find that any non-trivial functionality that isn't core to the challenge experience will usually be available as a dependency.

If the existing dependencies are out-of-date, or you think we should add additional ones, please [let us know](mailto:hello@codecrafters.io).

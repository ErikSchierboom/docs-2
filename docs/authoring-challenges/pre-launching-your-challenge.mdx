Once you've [planned your challenge](/docs/authoring-challenges/planning-your-challenge), you're ready to start adding enough information to
create the "overview" page.

We'll use this page to pre-launch your challenge and start attracting early users who'll help test your challenge & share feedback.

[Paul](mailto:paul@codecrafters.io) will create a draft challenge for you and grant you access to it.

At the start, the overview page for the challenge will look something like this:

<Frame>
  <img className="w-full" src="/img/draft-challenge-overview.png" />
</Frame>

AI Hints helps identify issues in your code.

## Changelog

### 9th Jan 2024: Initial Release

- AI Hints are now available for stage 2 on all challenges.
- AI Hints are available around 1-2 minutes after a submission is pushed. We stream real-time logs when hints are being generated.
- We've observed a 80% success rate in generating hints.
  - Currently, the most common failure is with submissions that have > 1 code files. This will be fixed in a future release.
  - Another common failure is with submissions that include non-UTF8 characters in logs. This will be fixed in a future release.

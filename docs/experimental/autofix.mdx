Autofix helps you automatically fix issues in your code.

This is a brand new feature that we're still iterating on. It's currently only available on stage 2, at it can take upto
a minute to run (you'll see real-time logs in the meantime).

Future versions of Autofix will be almost-instant, and will be available on all stages.

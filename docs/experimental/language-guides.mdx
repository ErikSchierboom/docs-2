description: Learn more about our experimental "Language Guides" feature

Language Guides are AI-generated guides to CodeCrafters stages. Unlike the official instructions for each
stage which are _mostly_ language-agnostic, Language Guides are tailored to your language.

This is a brand new feature that we're still iterating on. If you've got any feedback on this, please let us
know using the "Share feedback" button in the app:

## Changelog

### 10th Nov 2023: Initial Release

- Language Guides are now available for all stages & languages
- These are currently very rudimentary, and they're generated using only two inputs:
  - The official instructions for the current stage
  - The official instructions for the previous stage
- We'll improve these over time by feeding in more inputs, like Code Examples & official docs for a language.

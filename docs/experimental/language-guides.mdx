description: Learn more about our experimental "Language Guides" feature
---

Language Guides are AI-generated guides to CodeCrafters stages. Unlike the official instructions for each
stage which are _mostly_ language-agnostic, Language Guides are tailored to your language.

This is a brand new feature that we're still iterating on. If you've got any feedback on this, please let us
know using the "Share feedback" button in the app:

## Changelog

### 10th Nov 2023: Initial Release

- Language Guides are now available for all stages & languages
- These are currently very rudimentary, and they're generated using only two inputs:
  - The official instructions for the current stage
  - The official instructions for the previous stage
- We'll improve these over time by feeding in more inputs, like Code Examples & official docs for a language.


### 11th Nov 2023: Account for next stages

- In addition to the current & previous stage instructions,
we now also feed in instructions for the next stages. This 
helps keep the instructions focused on what's required for 
the current stage, and not suggest things that'll be 
covered in the next stages anyway.

### 13th Nov 2023: Language switcher

- You can now switch between languages in the language guide card.

### 15th Nov 2023: Account for previous stages, documentation links

- Where possible, language guides will now link to official documentation for Rust, Python & Go. Occasionally these links might be invalid, we'll fix this in a coming update.
- Language guides now account for all the previous stages you've done, not just the previous one - so they're less likely to repeat instructions from previous stages.

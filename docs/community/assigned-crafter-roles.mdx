title: 'How do I get assigned "Crafter" roles on Discord?'
description: When you complete challenges, you'll get assigned roles like "Redis Crafter", "Docker Crafter" etc.
---

These are displayed alongside your Discord profile, and in the sidebar where users are listed: Roles are synced every 24 hours. If you don't see roles synced 24 hours after you complete a challenge, it could be because we weren't able to link your GitHub username to your Discord username. Please let us know at [hello@codecrafters.io](mailto:mailto:hello@codecrafters.io) and we'll fix this. Here's a sample email template:

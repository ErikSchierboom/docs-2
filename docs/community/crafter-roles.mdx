description: You're assigned "Crafter" roles when you complete challenges. Here's what the various roles mean
---

- **Redis Crafter**: has completed the Redis challenge
- **Docker Crafter**: has completed the Docker challenge
- **Git Crafter**: has completed the Docker challenge
- **Multi Crafter**: has completed 2 or more challenges

These roles are displayed on your Discord profile, and in the sidebar where users are listed. Here's what that looks like:

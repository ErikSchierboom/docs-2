# Become a CodeCrafters Partner

Get paid for introducing a high-quality learning resource to your community.

### What is the Partner Program?

The Partner Program allows customers and developer advocates to earn referral fees for introducing 
CodeCrafters to their friends and community.

### What can I earn as a partner?

We pay out 25% of the revenue we collect from the customers you 
refer. For example, if you refer a customer to us that pays $6000 over their 
lifetime, you earn $1500. If you refer 100 such customers, you earn $150,000.
 
Subscribers spend up to $990 annually. There are no limits to the earnings. 

### Is the Partner Program for me?

Software Developers, Advocates, Influencers —  if you know developers, it's for you :)

* You can refer your friends, there are no minimums
* You can refer your community through newsletters, Twitter, YouTube, etc — there is no cap

### How do I make my referrals? 

Once you sign up, we'll create a unique referral link for you. You can share this link to make the referrals, 
and we'll automatically attribute the sign up and list it on your dashboard.

Your referral can try out CodeCrafters for free without a credit card, and upgrade to a paid subscription when they're ready. Once their subscription status changes, it will reflect on your dashboard instantly, and your payout value will be updated.

[CodeCrafters](https://codecrafters.io) is a platform loved by software engineers to practice advanced programming concepts.

recreating them from scratch — in any programming language. For example, someone looking to master 
Rust might do our [Build your own Redis](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/redis/overview) or

they hone their Rust skill, they simultaneously strengthen their networking and systems programming knowledge.

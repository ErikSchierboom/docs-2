> I've started the Docker challenge, enjoying it a lot so far. Just the right level of guidance, helpful and still gives you a lot of freedom to explore and learn for yourself.

> Huge fan of "build your own x". Really glad there's a nicely polished challenge site for them. Definitely going to recommend to others!

> It is great to see this kind of a platform evolving which is entirely different from the traditional coding platforms which we see typically see on internet.

> I think the instant feedback right there in the git push is really cool. Didn't even know that was possible!

> The Redis challenge was extremely fun; I think I mostly have feedback for the Redis and Python asyncio docs themselves. :laughing: I think I expected more hand-holding from the challenge; I ended up having to read the Redis Protocol specification doc pretty carefully in its entirety, which may have been your intent! The result felt like lightly-guided independent study, if that makes sense. (Which, again, was lots of fun)
